# ExoReL<sup>R</sup>

Version 2.4.2

Includes:
* A generation of reflected light spectra routine;
* A retrieval routine based on nested sampling (i.e. MultiNest).

## Authors
* [Mario Damiano](https://mdamiano.github.io/) (Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology)
* [Renyu Hu](https://renyuplanet.github.io/) (Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology)

## Collaborators
* Armen Tokadjian (Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology)
* Zachary Burr (ETH Zurich, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology)

## Installation:
Install python packages dependency:

`pip install numpy scipy astropy scikit-bio matplotlib spectres`

Download the .zip file from Github, unzip it and place it in a folder at your preference. 
Therefore, make the folder searchable for python in your `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` depending on your system

`export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:/full/path/of/folder/containing/ExoTR:"`

Download the folders "PHO_STELLAR_MODEL" and "forward_rocky_mod" from the following link : [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CQutXQ8Ki59TB9Dndo61sktwS3uOM7qZ?usp=sharing) .
Place the downloaded folders inside the ExoReL folder.

## Usage
You have to prepare the "retrieval_example.dat" and "forward_example.dat" parameters files before running ExoTR. Refer to the examples provided for guidance.
The full list of possible parameters are listed in the "standard_parameters.dat" file, placed inside the ExoTR package. Do not modify the "standard_parameters.dat" file.

You can generate a transmission spectrum by typing in a python instance or script.py file the following lines:

`import ExoReL`

`spec = ExoReL.CREATE_SPECTRUM()`

`spec.run_forward('forward_example.dat')`

You can run a retrieval by typing in a python instance or script.py file the following lines:

`import ExoReL`

`ret = ExoReL.RETRIEVAL()`

`ret.run_retrieval('retrieval_example.dat')`

To run the retrieval mode you need to have the MultiNest libraries installed in your system as well as `pymultinest (v2.11)`.

`pymultinest` is MPI compatible, therefore, you can run ExoTR to perform the sampling of the retrieval in parallel (you will need to install `mpi4py`):

`mpirun -np 10 python exotr_retrieval.py`

## Plotting the results
The plotting of the retrieval results is automatic and will produce the following graphs:
* Chemistry of the atmosphere versus the atmospheric pressure;
* Mean molecular mass versus the atmospheric pressure;
* The input spectral data and the best fit model calculated by the Bayesian sampling;
* The spectral contribution plot;
* The traces of the fitted free parameters;
* The posterior distribution corner plot.

In case `pymultinest` finds multiple solutions, ExoTR will automatically plot the aforementioned graphs for each of the solutions.
